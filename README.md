# Space-Invaders
This was just a project for fun to try and expand my animation skills with javascript.

Things I learned:
Game loop
Image resizing
Creating and drawing objects
Event listeners based on object proximity

Things I want to add/Improve:
More levels
different missiles
animation/sound when missile hits enemy
Restart game option
Life counter display
Convert hero and enemies to be more object based
